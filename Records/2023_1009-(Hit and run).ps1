audio log monday october 9th 2023, michael cook speaking, 
its currently 8:41pm, I'm making this audio log to talk about
uh- the audio log that i just transcribed over the last couple days as well as
the video that i'm about to make:

/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\

\____________|___________________________|______________________________|__________/

I don't know if I'm gonna make it public quite immediately, however um, ive come
across this notion of having to compile a bunch of videos together to sort of tell a
better narrative or story, and many of the videos I've uploaded already to my youtube
channel, uh, theyre evidence of uh- various things that uh- I could use...

00:00:41
...in another video to sort of clarify um, some of the things that have happened to me,
or like people watching me or whatever.

so i was just thinking about how over the last couple days that i've been using facebook,
and, every single time that I like hover, like, the last videoi that I postede to facebook
uh- typically if i post a video that links to youtube...?

00:01:04
There'll be a picture, it'll load the picture after I paste the link to the video,
but whats been happening is that it's NOT doing that now, and uh- sometimes when I hover my
mouse over a particular link or external resource...?

it'll collapse the image. Right...?
This is happening, right? And uh-

Ya know, what is the point of me, like uh- making indication of that...?

00:01:31
Well, um- Facebook has been playing games with me for several years now, ya know, and
uh- they- they try not to be very obtuse about it, they're very clever and hidden about it,
and if I show other people about the sort of things that I'm able to capture in video...

\____________|________________________________________________|______________________________|__________/

...people'll be like:
"Well, I don't believe that, or whatever..."

00:01:52
I have (2) videos opf me, posting something to facebook, multiple videos of me posting things to facebook,
and after I post something to facebook, something very strange happens.

and so, the fact of the matter is that this sorta happens everywhere in society, but
it happens a lot on facebook, and uh- the most alarming video that i've ever recorded in
my entire career, is the series of videos that i recorded on mar- uh, february 26th, 2022.

00:02:28
so, earlier, back on february 15th 2022, i had recorded myself editing a document, called
a matter on national security, which talks about pegasus/phantom, and uh- this is
long before david bombal covered it, this is uh months after nbc nightly news had a broadcast
about the name of the program, and as soon as i like heard about what it was capable of,
I knew that it was the program that was deployed to my apple iphone 8+ back in may 2020,
if not before that.

00:03:10
so my firm suspicion is that my device was targeted by people, rightm and uh- 
ya know, they use this software, ya know as joe rogan states on his podcast...

/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\
\ Date       | Name                              | Link                         | Duration /
/ 04/15/2023 | Joe Rogan - Privacy Doesn't Exist | https://youtu.be/fe-JiZtoI8U | 00:00:30 \
\____________|___________________________________|______________________________|__________/

...they got Bezos with pegasus version 1, and they got whoever else (tucker carlson) with
version 2. so version 1 you had to click the link, and your phone was infected, and version 2
they don't even need that, they just need your cell phone number.

00:03:38
however, the infection remains on the phone whether you have service or not.
and, you don't have to have service in order to be infected by this software.
and that is a particular point that i was trying ti make back in 2019, right, i had
contacted the national security agencty back in april of 2019, right...?

because, like, i had many firm suspicions beforehand that uh, september 11th 2001, uh-
was an inside job, and i've spoken about it like, numerous times, talkin' about it, 
robert korol, leeroy hulsey, feng xaio, xili quan, uh- the controlled demolition,
architects for 9/11 truth, rebekah roth, talkin' about all these things...?

00:04:23
right, and uh- ya know, one little/huge piece of the puzzle is, uh- donald rumsfeld,
talkin' about the 2.3T dollars that was just somehow MISSING, and they couldn't account for
it... like the day before the 9/11 attack happened.

and uh- what did the 9/11 attack target...?
well, the offices that were doing the accounting for the 2.3T dollars.
(...and the pentagon...)

and so... ya know this dude worked with haliburton, and uh, joe rogan goes into
depth talkin' about-

00:05:00
uh- very specific details that uh- allude to like, [sabotage in the government].

so, uh-
the reasoin why i think it was an inside job, is because of how many coincidental things
happened in conjunction, or either before or after the attack against the world trade
center.

00:05:20
so like, i wrote about a number of these details in my book, uh- top deck awareness,
not news. used to be news, now its not news. part of the not news network.

ya know like uh- I've still yet to go back and finish, like uh- editing that book
that i wrote... and like ya know, firmly publish it, because ya know, uhm, the format of
the book, or the document i should say, it's all black and white, it's not colored, like
many of the documents that ive been making recently...

00:05:53
and i think that i should go back and finish what i started with that book, the problem
is that a lot of the information that's in that book, or a lot of the things that i said
in that book, were just me being sorta like pissed off or upset about a number of details
and stuff...

and so, uhm...

00:06:08
sidestep some of those points, right...?

what is the reason for me bringing up all of that now...?

well, i do believe, that uh- back after i distributed a document named
a matter of national security, which spoke about pegasus and phantom, and edward snowden
and julien assange, and uh- collateral murder, the events of uh- new baghdad iraq, the
new baghdad iraq airstrike, the baghdad airstrike. right, and uh- ya know i distributed
a document all throughout the shenendehowa central school district campus...

00:06:46
right, and then oliver robinson, the superintendant mailed me a letter, that said that
i'm not allowed to post unauthorized materials throughout the school district, right
and then they uh- they contacted the proper authorities or whatever, right...?

and uh, I've had a bit of issues with uh, some of the staff over at shenedehowa,
because... well, let me put it this way, a number of miscommunications that i've had
with people, cause me to think that some people are just fuckin stupid...

00:07:21
right...? and so like when they dont like, make an effort to have a conversation with me,
or they say things like
"what is there to talk about...? ya know, your kids aren't in the school anymore...
et cetera and so forth..."

right...? uhm, when people make these statements out loud or whatever, they- theyre
like they think that i need to get like, help.

or that i need like, assistance, or that uh- i need like counseling or whatever.

but i think really, if anything, i just need to like, amplify my critique of certain
people.

00:07:55
Right...? theres a reason why i make so many audio recordings and videos, like,
sayin' that some people are fuckin' stupid. because i'll say things till i'm blue in
the fuckin' face.

some of the facts that people believe, that have been told to them as facts...
theyre not facts, theyre fuckin' falsehoods, and, when you go around tryin' to tell
people that, they're gonna be like:

"well, this dude is obviously delusional, and he needs help."

00:08:19
Yeah, you're right, I do need some help, I need to find a way to get around the
number of fucking morons that are standing in my way, and not taking me seriously...

when i say take me seriously, what i dont mean is some dude like paul pecor, daniel
nelson, or jeffrey margan from the saratoga county sheriffs office, being told,
that i had a video of my equipment being attacked on february 26th 2022, right,
and the attack happened because i logged intio facebook...

...and was recording something with open broadcast software...
...and what i recorded is not all that different from many of the other videos i
recorded, of something very strange happening when i'm using facebook.

00:09:04
right, but uh- ya know i was able to get a trifecta, because the video that i uploaded,
a matter of national security, right...? well, i went to go see that...

i posted it on my facebook account, because, like, the same sort of shit was happening,
uhm, when i made a video on february 25th 2022, right...?

so, this is how stupid some people are.
if i make a video called a matter of national security, talking about phantom/pegasus,
right...?

on, uh- february 15th  2022, or february 16th 2022, right...?

00:09:45
And then I go around the shenendehowa central school district, taping that document to
that video, around the school district, right...?

and then oliver robinson sends me a letter that says:
"don't come around the campus uhm, distributing unauthorized materials"... right?

And then, about a week later, I'm posting something on facebook while i have open
broadcast software recording the screen, and then...? oh, i'm able to record censorship
on facebook again...

00:10:20
and you know what was happening then, is similar to what's happening to my uh- user
experience on facebook lately...

\____________|_________________________|______________________________|__________/

right, and i think that whats happening, is someone thinks that i'm just fuckin'
annoying, and so they're trying to find little ways to piss me off, and i'm gonna
wind up recording something on video again, and then have another fuckin exhibit.

00:10:41
right, at some point like, i might have enough exhibits to *sigh*

I have to sorta curtail, like uh- my emotions right now, because I have so much
fuckin evidence that- someone thinks that i'm just fuckin stupid, and they know
that a bunch of other people are just gonna make that assumption that i dont know
what the hell im talkin about...

and uh- ya know, theyre gonna do that before reviewing any of my footage.

00:11:12
and the saratoga county sheriffs have done this numerous fuckin' times, cause,
ya know, theyre not there to like, investigate cybercrimes, or uh- like abuse of
uh, national surveill- u- national uh- security programs, and matters of national
security, theyre not there for that.

theyre there to respond to 911 calls about some dude like uh, whippin' his dick
out at a- in a- in a, public place, and then arresting them for that.

00:11:41
thats what the saratoga county sheriffs office are there for.
Eh, for the most part, its also what the new york state police do as well.
they respond to domestic incidents, uhn, disturbances, and things of that nature...
theyre not there to [investigate cybercrimes].

and uh- ya know, the new york state police does have a cybercrime division, but-

ya know, i really don't think that uh- i dont think that the new york state police-
would be even- would able to be even- would be able to even do anything about any
of this shit.

00:12:16
right...? like uh- someone is using pegasus to follow me around, and someone is
censoring me on facebook, makin it very apparent to me that they can fuck with
my user data...

\____________

...they can uh- censor me to- my exposure to other people...
Or I can make like thousands of fuckin' audio recordings talkin' abbout this shit,
and makin a bunch of videos, but if i dont convince people what the hells goin' on,
and uh piece it all together to the point where it is fucking...

00:12:44
impossible to deny that some people at facebook are just... playing god.

right, like, some people might even like, say:
"Ya know, why don't you use a different platform...?
ya know, go to twitter."

well, i also have a video from 2019 of this shit ha- this sorta same shit happening
on twitter...

/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\

\____________|________________________________________________|______________________________|__________/

so here's a description of what has happened to me over the last few years. right...?

00:13:11
january 2019, cve-2019-8936, a distributed denial of service attack in conjunction
with a ransomware attack at 1602 route 9, clifton park new york, 12065.

what is the common denominator there...?
[computer answers].

and then, march 7th, or march 8th, 2019, at 514 main street, bennington vermont, 05201.
what happened there...? oh, i was attacked by the same cve-2019-8936.

right...? and uh- ya know, after that, i noticed thar somebody from microsoft waas
watching what i was doing, because, maybe it was also the national security agency,
since i called them in april 2019, and talkin about the numerous things that i just
said, about uh- 9/11 being an inside job...?

00:14:08
right and then like, many details weren't known to me, but uh- ya know i like had
this suspicion that like the usa-patriot act, uniting amd strengthening america,
providing appripriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism, right...?

i don't know anypone from the shenendehowa central school district, that works there,
that is able to like, uh- tell me what the hell that statute says, or what it does...

00:14:29
right...? and like, i can make video after video of how educated i am about the subject,
and what my field of expertise is, but theyre gonna continue to think that i need
fuckin' like, help, that i need to go fuckin see somebody.

Or like uh- ya know, theyre gonna kick me off of the fuckin campus even though its a
public property. right...?

<maybe insert conversation with rebecca carmen...?>

The taxpayers pay for the property there, they do have the authority to like, tell people
that they can't come within a certain distance while the school is in session...

and that's- ya knowm that's understandable.
but uhm, if i'm trying ti raise awareness, and i'm being censired on social media
platforms, what the hell is my other recourse...?

00:15:11
what the hell can i do? i cant tell the police cause theyre fuckin morons and they
dont seem to get it, the ones that ive encountered and tried to tell em all this shit
at least...

i dont wanna say that theyre all stupid, or morons or whatever, but like they cant do
anything about any of this shit. so like, who else would i go to, the fbi...?

well i've already tried to go to the fbi numerous times, i've also been advised by the
saratoga county sheriffs office AND the new york state police, that i- that i should
contact the fbi regarding a number of incidents, but like- the fbi doesn't get back to
me...

00:15:43
ya know, like they dont get back to me.
eh, for all intents and purposes, like, i think that theyre only...
the only point of their existence from what i can tell, is to sorta like, just ya know
be there, and just deny a bunch of shit.

they might be doin shit that theyre not supposed to be doin', but- ya know, as long as
they can say:

"i can neither confirm or deny that et cetera and so forth..."
then they cam keep doin', they can keep pullin' another christopher wr-
james comey. or uh- ya know, i really dont know if christopher wray, uh- bears a lot
of similarities to james comey, i'm not close enough to be able to make those- uh-
that determination or not.

00:16:31
right but- ya know i'm sorta like, tangenting off uh- the things that i really wanna
talk about... 

ive seen numerous times inthe last few years, uh- in the last couple of years, like
really questionable shit on my computer equipment. and uhm, it has gotten me to the
point where i've sorta lost my cool with people, and that is why i make so many
documents, and i walk around tapin' shit door to door sometimes, and uh-

00:16:57
ya know, i cant expect like, my youtube channel to gain any uh- uh- to gain like
followers, or subscribers, when uhm, i'm balancing so many different things on my
channel. ya know, i'm not using the channel to be a youtuber, but thats sorta what
the point is, of youtube, right...?

so you can get a whole bunch of views on your videos...?
and, you can bring in additional subscribers, and get attention, and get fame and
recognition and everything....?

00:17:30
but a lot of people dont see youtube as like a place where you can just put evidence
of shit happening...? and, ya know, i get a little lost sometimes, uhm, in reference
to that, right...?

so, back on february 26th, 2022... right...?
i recorded uh- a blue screen of death, almost virtually identicak to the blue screen
of death that i caught when i logged into twitter, back in... i dunno, what was it, uh
october november or december of 2019...?

00:18:05
and, uh- this blue screen of death was caused by either, uh facebok itself, or
some sort of man in the middle attack, like the central intelligence agency, or
the federal bureau of investigation, or department of homeland security, or...
i'm not sure.

but- ya know the case that i'm makin here is that- if uh- youre just uh- an 
individual, and you dont work in the government, and you continue to do things that
are gonna piss somebody off in the government thats been ya know, getting an easy
ride- uh, havin a- a long uh- time on easy street just sorta havin' their fuckin'
way... 

00:18:50
well, uhm, theyre gonna try to discourage you somehow, and theyre gonna use nonverbal
means to do that. right...?

so... uhm, thats why i record some of the videos that i see.
it might not even be facebook thats been doin this shit to me, it might be someone
in the middle, someone in the middle... doin all this shit.

00:19:11
someone could be listening to me right now as i'm making this audio recording on
this phone, they might be pretending to be my friend this whole time, uhm, ya know,
like, making it apparent to me that they want my talent, or they want me to work
somewhere for like microsoft or whatever, so if i'm working on a script like i was
back in uh- february of 2020, i could say something about the microsoft deployment
toolkit, and then somebody can just change the fan speed on my server.

00:19:36
ya know. these are things that I like, have told police officers about before, like...
nys trooper carter, back in december of 2020. right...?

anyway, the video that i specified thatd the most damning thing that ive ever recorded,
is basically, um- after the blue screen of death was issued to my uh- laptop, on...
february 26th, 2022, well it was because i logged into my alternate facebook account.

and when i logged into alternate facebook account, like its only got (1) friend, its
my main account that is its main friend. well, i was able to see how facebook has
been like, taking all of the things that i post, and throwing them out of order,
out of chronological order, right...? maybe they do this to everybody.

00:20:33
i dont understand why they would, unless theyre trying to put more money in their
pocket, or... there's a much more nefarious reason than that...

uhm, ya know, uh-

three probably is a much more nefarious reason than that, but most peoplew theyre
not gonna believe that, because they use it and they dont notice, like, half the shit
that I do, theyre not gonna notice like uh- *sigh*

00:21:03
so many things happenin', uh- resultant of facebook, right...?
when i logged into my alternate account, i was looking to see the video that i had
posted earlier that day called:

/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\
\ Date       | Name                               | Link                         | Duration /

\____________|____________________________________|______________________________|__________/

...and on that video, which i linked to about a week or two ago...

00:21:28
...is uh- me like commenting on uh- the pineapple, on a pizza, and I say that pineapple
is a good topping on pizza, and then after i had posted that comment, uh- the comment
was like taken, it was abducted.

right...? this is sorta the same thing that i'm seeing with uh- the ad- the things
that i'm hovering over, on facebook now...? and its just taking those images out.

00:21:55
so i think that someone got pretty pissed off about like, ya know, a couple of videos
that i posted to my youtube account lately.

ya know, maybe i'm wrong about that, lets say that i'm wrong, right...?

all these things that i'm sayin', maybe i'm wrong about ALL of it...
and that its not col- its not related. at all.

because i know that the tougest critics are gonna say that, they'll be like:

"That has nothing to do with all this shit that you're sayin'..."

00:22:26
Well, if i was a lazy fuck, that had nefarious intent, and was doin this to a lot of
people, that is the first strategy that I would use... is to say:

"It's ALL in your head, you don't know what you're talkin about."

And I've noticed that a lot of people in society, they don't have any way to see this
shit coming, right...?

Let's say I'm wrong about that...

00:22:51
So, if I AM wrong about that, then uh- why did uh-
I receive a blue screen of death when I logged into my alternate account, and after
I restarted the computer, on... february 26th, 2022, right...?

I logged back in to facebook, and then I like, went down to where the video was,
"censorship on facebook", and then when I clicked on it, well...

the video can clearly be seen from my mobile device, as well as my laptop that was
recording the screen using OBS, I have (2) angles of this shit...

00:23:34
Right...? Well, what happened was, as soon as I saw the- clicked on the link in the
video, well YouTube was reporting that it was displaying the [1080p HD] version of the
video that I uploaded...?

but the resolution was downgraded to like [360p], or [480p].
and what THAT means, is that it wasnt in HD, but it was repoorting HD, because I was
being CENSORED by somebody, eh- it was a conjunction of YouTube AND facebook doing
this.

00:24:08
So, i know that youtube has been censoring me...
I know that facebook has been censoring me...
i know that...

theyre trying to make it seem like my channel is dead...
theyre trying to make me seem like i'm just a bat shit crazy lunatic, and a lot of
people probably believe that, but-

00:24:27
fact of the matter is I have so many fucking pieces of evidence, to- to support my
claim, that someone's using really sophisticated attacks against me, and they dont like
the fact that i will call them a lazy cocksucker left and right, and they really care
about their appearance, and uh- when some guy like me, who's just (1) guy, comes around,
and uh- has the history that he does, theyre gonna assume that people will...

ya know, jump to the hastiest conclusion that they can make, (...occams razor...)
and assume that i dont know what the hell i'm talking about.

00:25:06
so thats why i like have to compile more videos, and make more audio recordings just
like this, and then slowly piece together a re- a pretty compelling narrative.

ya know, uh- like um- i was thinkin' about this, right...?
anytime that i noticethat something is strange or off, or not correct, or whatever...?

00:25:30
i put a lot of thought into like, who would do this, if- if- i- I use the scientific
model, the scientific method, to be able to logically deduce, like if somebody is doing
something malicious, to me, specifically, right...?

if i know that most people, or that everybody lies, right...?

well, ok. everybody lies, what can i logically deduce off of that...?

00:25:56
Well, um, somebody whos got a- a- a reason to try to censor me, is gonna do so because
they consider me a threat, eh- i think that is also able to be easily proven, right...?

and then also, further to that point, um, someone who thinks that im fuckin stupid, uh-
knows that i'm not fuckin stupid, they know that other people will assume that i'm
either fuckin stupid or crazy, and then so...

00:26:31
they'll continue to spam the shit out of people, like:
"Oh- he doesn't know what he's talkin' about..."
...prompting me into making additional audio recordings, prompting me into like,
contacting agencies and departments, prompting me to continue writing stuff...

prompting me to continue recording videos and audio recordings, prompting me into
having to find a way to sew it all together, knowing that i'm like overwhelmed with
all this shit that i have to do...

00:27:00
and then, ya know, the algorithms that are pointing- uh pointing information back at
me... so like, facebook and youtube, um- ya know, just... sorta overloading me with
uh- videos that i can watch, or content or whatever...?

but the content that's being directed at me, ias pretty telling that uh- *sigh*
they want me tobe in this paranoid state, that like, doesn't trust, um, like
authority figures or whatever.

00:27:26
so like, take a step back to what i recorded on uh- february 26th 2022, right...?
Like uhm, censorship on facebook...?

eh- right after like, i went around the central-the shenendehowa central school district
taping the document about collateral murder...

\____________|___________________|______________________________|__________/

...phantom and pegasus, and uh- having oliver robinson send me a letter saying uh:
"don't distribute unauthorized materials throught the district"

Oh- a week later, i record a video of censorship on facebook, and what did i talk
about like, in the document that i distributed...?

Oh, censorship, on social media platforms.

00:28:12
think i might've been sayin that like a while now, right...?

so when i say censorship, i don't mean like, if i say fuck, shit, cock, piss,
pussy, cocksucker, motherfucker, if i say any of those words, and they get bleeped
out, thats not the type on cenasorship that i'm fucking talking about.

the type on censorship that i'm talking about, is when i record a video of someone
doing something illegal to me, and then someone tries to minimize the significance of
that fucking video, and, they change the fuckin' metrics on all the videos that i'm
uploading to, ya know youtube or facebook...?

00:28:40
like, ive recorded this numerous fuckin' times.
they think that theyre fuckin' slick, but- every single time that they do it, it flips
a switch in my mind that theyre just trying to get away with doin' whatever the hell
they want to, and uh- ya know...

the best thing that i can do, is to continue recording it, and then stapling it
together, and then, ya know, i can't even like, expect the police to be able to even
do anything about it...

00:29:11
because, heh. i have an audio recording of uh- these dudes from scso on march 1st, (2022)
which is like (4) days after uh- i recorded the video, of like youtube and facebook
kinda like workin' together to censor me, and, someone engaging like a ransomware attack,
on my laptop which failed...

right...?

so i was able to get a whole bunch of event logs, and then save the event logs,
and i spent a really long time parsing through a whole bunch of logs.

00:29:46
looked at dism, looked at cbs, looked at sfc, which is basicallty all that- leads to
the same thing, and uh- wgat i was able to determine, was that uh- the graphics driver,
was the root cause of the infection.

so it wasnt like the graphics driver failed, no- what i mean is that the graphics driver
was designed by somebody, to watch what the hell i was doing.

so the graphucs driver COULD be being used, to initiate these exploits.

00:30:20
so who makes the graphics drivers...?
oh, nvidia, or amd. or uh- intel.

so if these (3) companies are involved in allowing things like spectre-
spectre or meltdown, or uh- ya know, various other exploits to cpu's and
graphical processing units, well they would stand to gain a lot by allowing uh-
agencies like the fbi or the nsa or the cia to have tools that allow them to
commandeer a computer system directly, and what could they do to really stop it
anyway...?

00:31:01
ya know...?
these companies are probably doing these things, and if theyre NOT doing these things,
then, ya know, theres another explanation for all of that, that requires, uh a bit more
thought, but that- a bit more thought always breaks down to like...

someone in the government, sorta like, lying to people, or somebodys fucking lying
somewhere, is basically what i'm getting at...

right...? somebody's fucking lying somewhere. and so... *long sigh*

00:31:36
then, i start writing the book, ya know i had this mishap at saratoga hospital,
and the whole entire time that i'm there, i keep my wits about me, because i know that
the doctors that work at saratoga hospital (...mental health unit...) uhm, theyre
basically k-mart doctors.

so what i mean by k-mart doctors, is.. thats where they got their medical degree,
is k-mart.

00:31:58
ya know, k-mart isn't like a- a- a- college or a school where you could get a doctorate,
but they made an exception in [richard todd loeber]'s case.

and uh- ya know, for all intents and purposes, [susan mcdermott]'s fuckin' case.
right...?

00:32:17
ya know, like um- some of the sheriffs that work for the saratoga county sheriffs,
and some of the troopers that work for the state troopers...

they ALSO, got their ability to be a police officer, from k-mart.

ehhhh, i am like, being really fuckin' obtuse about that, but the- the analogy that i'm
attempting to uh relay here, is that theyre not very meticulous, and they dont like,
uh- pay attention to the details, nor do they ask for the fuckin evidence that i've
been like hangin' onto this whole time...

and then, ya know, i get overwhelmed by the fact that i'm just hangin' onto it,
it's been so long since i've recorded some of these things, what can i do to
influence additional people to give a shit...?

00:33:01
well, if i go around like uh- swearin' and cursin' up a storm or whatever, well, i
know that a lot of people are gonna be...

ya know, offended, by my language...
ya know, in a country where you have the uh- the right, to speak free- to freely
express yourself, eh... its fuckin' strange, that we have this amendment that allows
us to freely express ourselves, but we sorta have to watch our language in certain-
in many situations, right...?

00:33:33
so, um- put a pin in all of that...
whats happened between march 1st, (2022) and now, uhm...
are the fact that, ya know, the metrics don't always pan out, i've also noticed that
um, in the same way that i came to the determination that- uh, curse words are considered
bad, was uh implemented by rich people or the british monarchy, in that same exact
fashion, i've been able to uh- ascertain the fact that most of the videos that are
popular on youtube or whatever medium...?

like, theyre not doing anything that threatens someone's position or authority, in the
government or uh- society or their wealth, right...?

00:34:24
none of the videos on facebook reels do anything to threaten mark zuckerbergs net worth.
or really, any of the other billionaires.

uhm, none of the videos on youtube, uh- go to like uh- ya knowm uh-
convey a sense of incompetence in the government...

the- there's plenty of videos that-
